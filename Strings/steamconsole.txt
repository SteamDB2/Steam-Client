-- Logging in to Steam --Connecting to your Steam account using steamcmd is similar to using the regular Steam client UI. You can login, logout, and set your Steam Guard email code. Any other account management should be done using the Steam client UI.The first time logging in to a given account on this machine, you'll need to specify the password. For subsequent sessions you can omit the password; using the 'logout' command will clear those cached credentials (your password is never stored locally) and require a password on the next login. If the password is required but not supplied as part of the 'login' command, you will be prompted for a password. To disable this prompt, first set the '@NoPromptForPassword' ConVar to 1 (see the help topic 'convars' for more info). If the prompt is disabled and the password is required, the login command will fail.Note: you may login anonymously using "login anonymous" if the content you wish to download is available for anonymous access.Common commands:               login : Login to Steam              logout : Disconnect from Steamset_steam_guard_code : Enter the Steam Guard code that was emailed to you for authorizing this machine
You can use the 'runscript' command to execute a text-file script. The file should have each desired command listed sequentially on a new line. The filename and extension do not matter; you only need 'read' access to the file. Each line of the file will be executed sequentially.
-- Console Variables --ConVars are variables used to set options and program behavior. Often, but not always, Steam client ConVars are named beginning with the '@' character. The '@' character is simply part of their name, it is not a directive itself.To see the current value of a ConVar, simply type its name into the console and hit enter. To change the value, type the name of the ConVar followed by the desired value, and hit enter.
-- Building Steam Applications --Full documentation of this process is beyond the scope of this little 'help' system, and so it is provided as part of the Steam SDK.If you are a licensed Steam Application Developer, then you will be using this tool to 'build' your game or application and create update patches in the Steam system. In that case, the 'app_build' command is the one you're looking for.
-- Downloading and updating Steam applications installed on the local machine --Use the 'app_update' command to download and update Steam games and applications on this computer. This is generally intended for game dedicated server installations, and will only work for games that have been converted to the new Steam HTTP download system - for games that haven't been converted yet, you should use the older 'HldsUpdateTool' (Windows) / 'steam' (linux) command-line tool.By default, the game is downloaded to the folder "./SteamApps/common/<gamename>". To change this location, use the 'force_install_dir' command to set the target directory BEFORE running app_update. Note: Steam will create a directory within the target directory for storing state information and temporary files; the name of this folder will be a string of numbers and letters 40 characters long.You will first need to login to Steam using an account which has access to the game, or anonymously - type 'help login' for more information.It's likely you'll want to put all of the necessary calls into a script file (see "runscript"); here is an example file:  @ShutdownOnFailedCommand 1 @NoPromptForPassword 1 force_install_dir ../Ricochet/ login anonymous app_update 60 validate quit
